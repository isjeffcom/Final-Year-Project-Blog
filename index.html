    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h3 id="Overall"><a href="#Overall" class="headerlink" title="Overall"></a>Overall</h3><p>The ultimate gold for this idea is to try to find a way to let a user can build a data visualization format(chart, map, etc…) who without coding and data science background. Or maybe not completely solve this question but to bring it closer.</p>
<h3 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h3><p>The concept of No-Code is rising. Many software is targeting to deliver an easy-to-maintain application without coding skill required to their clients.<br>Like in this article: (<a href="https://medium.com/@rrhoover/the-rise-of-no-code-e733d7c0944d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/@rrhoover/the-rise-of-no-code-e733d7c0944d</a>) Ryan said that “As creating things on the internet becomes more accessible, more people will become makers. It’s no longer limited to the &lt;1% of engineers that can code resulting in an explosion of ideas from all kinds of people”. He listed a range of No-Code products and suggested that the No-Code concept is a new trend in software field.</p>
<p>Specifically, in the business area, a BI tool built upon the No-Code concept by Microsoft is getting popular.(<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/no-code-software-microsofts-power-apps-gets-better-teams-links-and-mixed-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.zdnet.com/article/no-code-software-microsofts-power-apps-gets-better-teams-links-and-mixed-reality/</a>). By using simple drag and drop editor, any user is able to build their own data visualization pages. </p>
<p>A Microsoft senior engineer says to a Chinese media that he believes No-Code or codeless will be a core element in the digital transformation. He defined a role who using these platform as “Power User”, like a senior Excel user or Powerpoint user, they are skilled working but not essentially a programmer or researcher. He mentioned four key points in the No-Code platform: </p>
<ol>
<li>The No-Code platform needs to solve most of the business need.</li>
<li>The No-Code platform needs to easily merge and integrate into the target business’s current IT system.</li>
<li>Consider the cost of using the No-Code platform carefully.</li>
<li>Figure out who will be using this platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Chinese media report(by CSDN): <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/eO_B8u0M6HwUim9Yyrzs3g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/eO_B8u0M6HwUim9Yyrzs3g</a> </p>
<p>In the industry, many companies starting to invest in No-Code platform like Voiceflow, a No-Code tool to build a Voice Assistant (<a href="https://www.voiceflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.voiceflow.com/</a>). It seems that their client does not get satisfied by buying coded software and maintenance services, but they are more likely would purchase software they can control and use.</p>

<h3 id="Business-Intelligence"><a href="#Business-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Business Intelligence"></a>Business Intelligence</h3><p>Data-driven business intelligence(BI) is a phenomenon topic along with data science and data visualization technology. When business dealing with big data, especially when the data is too big for any human can interpret without using a certain visualization method. </p>
<p>Despite there is a business in the word BI, this technology is not only work in the industrial. Let made an example of the COVID-19 epidemic, in the year of the Internet, a huge amount of data was been created by statistic, contact tracing, academic and medical research. How to merge these data, visualized, and make it understandable for the human being to analysis eventually. BI technology might be the way.</p>
<h3 id="Existed-Product"><a href="#Existed-Product" class="headerlink" title="Existed Product"></a>Existed Product</h3><p>Many products were produced recently such as Microsoft BI, Oracle BI, IBM BI, ArcGIS(used to use by UK government)….. However, many of them require, more or less, some level of data science and programming background.</p>
<p>Take an example of Superset. An open-sourced BI web application built upon Python and JavaScript, created by Airbnb, incubating by Apache foundation. (<a href="https://airbnb.io/projects/superset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://airbnb.io/projects/superset/</a>) This software was been comment as one of the easiest to use BI application. However, it is still, from the user experience aspect, it still does have a friendly learning-curve to use. One of my friend who working in a tech company comments that ‘Superset still is a tool build for developer and data sciences’. In his company, if a product manager wants to view a custom chart in BI, they ask a developer to make one for them. </p>

<h3 id="Visual-Scripting"><a href="#Visual-Scripting" class="headerlink" title="Visual Scripting"></a>Visual Scripting</h3><p>In my point of view, this can be improved. A BI tool should be easy to use with a friendly learning curve. So what I can do? I took an idea from Unreal Engine which is a game development tool I’ve used before. In the Unreal Engine, there is a visual scripting tool called: Blueprint. The Blueprint visual scripting tool use graph, node and connection line elements to let even a designer can quickly construct their concept scripting for the game. At least that is an image what they expecting.</p>
<h4 id="Unreal-Engine-Blueprint"><a href="#Unreal-Engine-Blueprint" class="headerlink" title="Unreal Engine Blueprint"></a>Unreal Engine Blueprint</h4><p>Introduction from Unreal Offcial:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6mskTgL7kU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6mskTgL7kU</a></p>


<h4 id="My-Design-Draft"><a href="#My-Design-Draft" class="headerlink" title="My Design Draft"></a>My Design Draft</h4><p>So I think if that is possible bring the visual scripting concept into data science area. Here is some concept design draft I draw for this new system. The objective is: One with a very basic math background can create a complex data visualization graph. </p>

        <p>AR/VR/XR meeting is an interesting development throughout the global epidemic. Most of the industry needs a way to enhance their remote working experience. Can people use what they have on their hand to build up an XR reality enhancement meeting instead of a video meeting? What will be changed?</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kLN2It5ez5Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This is a demo I made under Web XR API which allow you run VR/AR/MR in a mobile phone from a webpage without downloading any additional package or App. It’s also easy to impliment a whiteboard into the scene like this one:<br><a href="https://codepen.io/michaelsboost/pen/cnCAL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://codepen.io/michaelsboost/pen/cnCAL</a></p>
<p>So this is another idea but it’s more practical than the big data one.</p>

We seem to live in a peaceful world after the World War II. However, is that truly fix everything or we are in another cycle of history and everything just a delusion. Consider most people can only see a small window of the timeline we currently excited, we everything we see and think is just all bias.</p>
<p>What is the true relationship between the ruling class and the general public? Down to the very base question: Who created power? What is power?</p>

<h3 id="Technology"><a href="#Technology" class="headerlink" title="Technology"></a>Technology</h3><p>I am watching the Westworld TV series recently, and it describes a society that dominated by an AI which use an algorithm to predict every single person’s move, therefore to governing the human race and a ‘perfect’ world. However, the main idea in this show is that human have no freedom in this kind of society, but everyone’s life was planned. When the hero destroys the AI, a war beginning, the world looks like hell. So it’s truly only freedom or chaos that we can choose? Is the algorithm the final solution of all? What is freedom?</p>

<h3 id="Privacy"><a href="#Privacy" class="headerlink" title="Privacy"></a>Privacy</h3><p>How to decided what is privacy and what is not? For example, a person walking on a street and somebody took a photo with him/her (but he/she are not the main object) and for most of the cases, the photographer was not violating the law. And people can still recognize the person. So why a high-resolution camera pick-up a human face in a public area, and send it back to a server to run facial recognization application that is violating privacy?</p>
<p>The law said it depends on how this camera owner going to use it. But face that sort of data that everyone can see it on any public area. Should they really be protected? How horrifying these surveillance technologies can do? What is the way we can alert people? Or it is already happening but we just do not know? I used to work in one of the largest  tech company, it is really quite concerning for some application in used and people have no idea….</p>
<p>Like another TV Series Person of Interest, same writer as the Westworld by Jonathan Nolan. The show illustrated a man who built an AI to defend national security by using massive surveillance feed provided by the government. In this case, he uses this system to protect human life and national security. Of cause later in this show also introduced the bad guys who want to misuse this system…and…do many standard dark side staff.</p>
<img src="/Final-Year-Project-Blog/2020/05/16/some-ideas/poi1.jpg" class="" title="person of interest">

<p>Many people believe that using AI system to enhance massive surveillance can protect public safety, especially when they met the delivery package was stolen or terrorist attacks. Many countries are building a massive surveillance system like the US in the name of national security, and many of them don’t have a long history valuing civil right, so what consequence could that produce?</p>
<p>Like I always said, imagine if you piss off police officer or his/her child, and he/she wants to retaliate. How easy could that be if the government has such a big power to watch on everyone?</p>
<p>Can all these above merges with data visualization? Who knows.</p>

        <h3 id="Thinking"><a href="#Thinking" class="headerlink" title="Thinking"></a>Thinking</h3><p>I am struggling in create an idea for my final year project. It is not an easy thing. I have no idea what I should do now.</p>
<p>A specific area that I would like to explore in is data visualization which it has is been quite a popular topic recently. Whether from the general, digital art aspect or business aspect, the data visualization are getting attention through the development of big data, social network and massive surveillance technologies. Furthermore, data visualization start or continuing performing a vital role in these areas.</p>
<p>Take COVID-19 outbreak as an example, whether government decision making, scientific research also the general public requires accurate data collecting and digital visualizing implementation. The governments, media, academy institutions and many third-party have made many digital products for visualizing the COVID-19 data.</p>
<p>Like me, for instance, I am personally made a website to deliver COVID-19 data in the UK targeting the general public <a href="https://covid19uk.live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://covid19uk.live</a>. And the government did keep improving their own data visualization methods. This dashboard for instance: <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/</a></p>
<p>I have some ideas related to many different aspects like merge social network data or surveillance data to do visualization and somehow remain, people, how important to protect their digital privacy. For instance, I’ve made an Emotion Map in the Design with Data course by scraped images from social network and use AI facial recognition technology to read the facial expression, and eventually concluded an emotion score for an area. (<a href="https://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~s1888009/ef/#/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://playground.eca.ed.ac.uk/~s1888009/ef/#/map</a>)</p>
<p>Indeed, artificial intelligence is also a great topic to talk about regarding the rapid development of this technology, which I am recently taking an online course related to that.</p>
<h3 id="Roadmap"><a href="#Roadmap" class="headerlink" title="Roadmap"></a>Roadmap</h3><p>Well, because I have no specific idea for now and I think I need a way to somehow manage a brainstorm for that so:</p>
<img src="/Final-Year-Project-Blog/2020/05/16/initial-rodemap/rd.jpg" class="" title="roadmap-hand-draft">

<p>Stage 1: Research, involve consider topics or ideas in political, economic, culture and technology aspect. For this stage, it is important to produce some sort of manifesto and general concept for doing further studies.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Idea, which I should have a general completed idea which can be explained in one or two sentences.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Feasibility Testing, which I shell test if the concept is doable.</p>
<p>Stage 4: Low-Fidelity Prototype, which to produce a basic prototype like design draft, UX flow or blueprints.</p>
<p>and so on… it’s the general staff like design, development, audience research and feedback etc…</p>
